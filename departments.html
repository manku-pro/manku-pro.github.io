               	<h3>Welcome to Chirdren Department</h3>
                <p>The Children department is one of the departments in the Kijitonyama Pentecost Church (KLPK). This department deals with giving service to children in the church, at home and at school. This service is provided, to enable children have a good parental care and training on spiritual values. This gives children a sense of character and good conduct in their lives. 
 
								The purpose of the children’s department is to lead children to the knowledge of salvation by the Lord Jesus. Children ministry is a very important service in the church. Obviously life begins at childhood and continues to grow physically; similarly, spiritual life begins in childhood. If the baby is well-nursed, well-fed and well-cared for, he/she grows with good health and good conduct. This can be observed in all aspects of his life, namely, the soul and the body. The time we spend teaching children, builds up the image of their future life. The Bible says, “Nurse a child in the good way; he will not leave it even when he is old” (Prov. 22: 6). In other words the thing we teach children, they live in their memory throughout their life; they cannot be forgotten besides rate age. Knowing that we have been called, to serve God and to make all people disciples of Jesus, the church directs his resources and strength into this area which have a very big return for ​​God’s work.The Lord Jesus gave the children ministry great concern and made it his priority. The Church considers today’s Children are the builder and part of the expansion of the church tomorrow. Therefore the church has a good strategy for managing the children’s department by looking at the needs of the equipment, the kind of training to their teachers and their self-sacrificing. Emphasis is on to develop teachers in order to improve the training or teaching given to the children.</p>
								<p>Through this Department the Church receives the following benefits: –
								   1.The Church enables children to learn God’s knowledge well and understand them from their childhood rather than waiting while they are grown to adulthood.<br>
								   2.Through teaching to the children the Church is preparing tomorrows servants who will make the church continue doing well in near future.<br>
								   3.The Gospel of Jesus Christ is based on showing love to people, so it is also important to show children this unconditional love of Jesus at their tender age. Through their services children are taught this great love of Jesus.<br>
								   4.The Church uses this department to build a foundation for the lives of children who are the church leaders in the future and who will carry the word of Christ for the next generation.<br>
								   5.Child ministry is a way to reach others, reaching children is easy to reach parents and their neighbors. When a parent observes what is going on inside his child, even if he is far off he can do the follow-up and finally in that way get convicted.<br>

                 <p>Huduma ya Uinjilisti ni huduma muhimu sana ya injili inayoliwezesha Kanisa  kutambua na kuwaunganisha watu wote waliomo katika kanisa na jinsi ambavyo neema mbali mbali za utendaji zinavyofanya kazi katika kutimiza kazi ya injili. 

								Kwa sababu hiyo watu waliomo katika huduma ya injili wengi wao wana wito wa uinjilisti na utendaji wa wito mara nyingi hutofautiana kutoka mtu hadi mtu.Bwana Yesu aliliagiza Kanisa kueneza injili ulimwenguni kote (Mk 16:15). Yesu alipokusudia kwenda katika miji na mahali mbali mbali, aliwatuma watu aliowachagua ili wamtangulie kwenda huko kwa kusudi la kufanya maandalizi ya safari zake za kutangaza neno la Mungu katika sehemu hizo. Aliwatuma, kati ya wale sabini aliwaweka, wawili wawili. Basi, baada ya hayo Bwana aliweka na wengine, sabini, akawatuma wawili wawili wamtangulie kwenda kila mji na kila mahali alipokusudia kwenda mwenyewe (Lk 10:1). Kwa msingi huo kazi ya injili tangu mwanzo ilipangwa na kuratibiwa ilikishirikisha wanainjili kuitenda.Kama Yesu alihitaji watu wa kumtangulia alikokusudia kwenda, KLPK inahitaji nguvu ya pamoja zaidi. Umoja wa huduma ya uinjilisti kama Yesu alivyowatuma wawili wawili, unawapa uwezo wa kutenda kazi ya Mungu kwa nguvu zaidi, kuliko kama kazi ile ingefanywa na mtu mmoja mwenye wito wa uinjilisti.</p>

								<p>Kwa kuwepo Huduma hii, Kanisa linapata manufaa yafuatayo:
								   1.Huduma ya uinjilisti huratibu na kusimamia kazi ya injili kanisani kwa kuandaa mipango ya namna ya kutekeleza kazi hiyo na kisha kulihusisha Kanisa katika utekelezaji.<br>
								   2.Huduma ya Uinjilisti huandaa mikutano ya injili katika matawi mbalimbali ya kanisa la KLPK.<br>
								   3.Huduma ya Unjilisti hushughulika na ushuhudiaji aidha wa kundi au wa mtu mmoja mmoja.<br>
								   4.Huduma ya uinjilisti hufuatilia waongofu wapya, ambao wameokoka katika mikutano waliyofanya, ili waweze kusimama katika wokovu. Hii ni muhimu sana ili kazi iliyofanyika iweze kuzaa matunda yanayodumu.<br>
								   5Huduma ya Unjilisti hulea na kukuza vipawa vya wainjilisti, na kuwafanya watambulike na kutumiwa na watu wengine ndani na nje ya Kanisa.<br>
								   6.Huduma ya uinjilisti inahusika na kufuatilia fedha zinazotolewa na kanisa au michango mbali mbali inayotolewa kwa ajili ya injili, na kuhakikisha kuwa fedha hizo zinatumika sawa sawa na malengo yaliyokusudiwa.<br>
								   7.Viongozi wa huduma hii hufanya vikao mbali mbali vinavyohusu maendeleo ya injili katika kanisa. Pia wanao wajibu wa kukumbusha uongozi wa kanisa juu ya mipango mbali mbali ya injili iliyopo kanisani na jinsi ya kuifadhili ili iweze kutimizwa.<br>
